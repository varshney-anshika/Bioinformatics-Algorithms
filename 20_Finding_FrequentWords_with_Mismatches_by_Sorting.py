# This function takes a string Text and two integers k and d as inputs and returns the most frequent k-mers with at most d mismatches in Text as a set. The function converts each k-mer in Text into a numerical representation, sorts the resulting list of numbers, and then uses the ITERATIVENEIGHBORS function to identify all the d-neighbors of each k-mer that appear max_count times in Text.
